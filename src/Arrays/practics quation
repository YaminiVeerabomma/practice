**Given an array arr[] of size n, the task is to find all the Leaders in the array. An element is a Leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side.
Note: The rightmost element is always a leader.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17 5 2]
Explanation: 17 is greater than all the elements to its right i.e., [4, 3, 5, 2], therefore 17 is a leader. 5 is greater than all the elements to its right i.e., [2], therefore 5 is a leader. 2 has no element to its right, therefore 2 is a leader.
** cost of all prefix array 
** cost of array
**count of number of elements in array[1,2,1,3,1] output{1-3,2-1,3-1}
**cost of   distinct elements in array
** cost of min prefixes array
